# Air-pollution-epidemiology-using-Machine-Learning
I tried to integrate machine learning research with air pollution epidemiology to support our environment. 
Specifically, the pollutant 'carbon monoxide (CO)' is being monitored and measured by the 'Halifax' air quality station.
I investigated the hourly data on ambient carbon monoxide (CO) in Nova Scotia. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a very poisonous gas that results from incomplete combustion of fuels.Simultaneously, I looked
at whether traffic flow has an impact on roadside carbon monoxide levels, and hence air quality.Then I applied linear regression
for the prediction of the average CO levels.Howeverto investigate some patterns in the data I decided to apply clustering
analysis to identify groups where traffic regions and CO levels are correlated. Finally, I built
two different models, one using the decision tree classifier and another using Na√Øve Bayes to
classify the dataset according to the labels provided by the clustering method.

To understand traffic flow data, we can access
